           There are a number of situations in which your personal
            information may help us give you better products.
             For example: phone with an associate. 
             When you interact with flawless heart, 
             we may collect personal information 
             relevant to the situation, such as your name, 
             mailing address, phone number, email address, 
             and contact preferences; your credit card information 
             and other information. We also collect information
              for market research purposes – such as your occupation
               and where you use your computer – 
               to gain a better understanding of our customers
                and thus provide more valuable service. 
                We collect information regarding customer
                 activities on our websites. 
                 This helps us to determine how best
                  to provide useful information to customers
                   and to understand which parts of our websites,
                    products, and Internet services are
                     of most interest to them. 
                     We may use personal information to 
                     provide products that you have
                      requested as well as for auditing, 
                      research, and analysis to improve 
                      flawless heart products. We collect 
                      personal information about users of our 
                      websites through activities such as 
                      purchase transactions and completion of
                       forms on our websites. Such information
                        is collected when users register or
